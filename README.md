## 5.0 	COMMISSIONING OF PRESS 	(0054.000) 	

## 5.1 	COMMISSIONING OF PRESS 	

### 5.1.1 	FILLING OF THE OIL COMPONENT WITH OIL 	

Directions:
- Do not put non—filtered oil directly from drums into tank. 	
- Check the tank for contamination; it has to be thoroughly clean on the outside and in the inside.
- No dirt particles or liquids 	— including remains of a preceding fill — may be left behind.
- Fill up prescribed oil type via the intake filter into the tank, i.e. up to the edge of the sight glass.
- No foreign matter must be allowed to get into the oil tank. 	
- Oil shall only be pumped into the tank via a filter combination. A respective connection exists at the filter. 	
- At low temperatures it is recommended to warm up the pressure liquid, so that pass—through by the fine—mesh filter may be facilitated. 	
- Refill up to the prescribed oil level, in case the oil level will decrease when the press is put into operation, or by blow-off of entrapped air. 
- Fix label indicating type of oil, quantity and date of oil fill. 	
- Switch on oil heating after filling of tank. 	
- Pipe lines, screw connections, hoses and hydraulic components should be thoroughly checked for tightness.

> Attention : 	
> Watch moving in and out cylinders or rotating swivelling 	
> gear and hydromotors! Danger of accident ! 	

## 5.2 	SWITCH-ON OF PUMPS/CHECK OF DIRECTION OF ROTATION (0055 .003) 

Remove all electrical fuses for the pump motors inside of the switch—board but the one for the unit, which one wants to start with. Most appropriate is to start with the main drive unit. Switch on the main switch at the switch cabinet and set pushbutton on __PUMPS ON__.

> __! !ATTENTION! ! 	
> ! Pump housing must be filled with oil when setting pump in operation !__

Check at first pump unit for its __correct direction of revolution__ (in clockwise direction seen on the shaft end — direction of revolution arrow).
In case motor rotates in counter revolution it must be switched off instantaneously and has to be repoled so to save the pump. 	

> __ATTENTION!!__ 	
> __Pump damage after one minute running in the wrong direction!__

Proceed in the same manner with the other drive units, by bringing into action, step by step the respective fuses.

It must be established, that the drive unit is 	
- correctly aligned , that there are 	
- no vibrations to notice and 	
- no humming noises to be heard. 	

## 5.3 	DE-AIRING OF PLANT 	(0056.000)

At the first setting—into—operation the press can only be charged after __DE-AIRING__ has been effected.

The drive-motors are to be switched-on and the press to be set onto __"CIRCULATION"__.

After about 5 minutes, you can start de—airing. Loosen the 	de-airing screws at the highest spots of the pipelines; when there is no more foamy oil escaping, the screws have to be 	tightened again. Check on the oil level inside of the container and if required add some oil. 

Thereafter go through all the functions of the press when idling, so that any remaining trapped air will be removed. It has to be observed that all the existing cylinders will run through their complete stroke action. 	

Generally the plant will be completely de-aired after about 10 - 15 minutes running time. 	
Indications of correct de—airing are:
- no oil—air mixture (foam) inside of the container , 	
- no abnormal noises inside of the hydraulic plant, 	
- no jolting movement of the piston rod, motors etc . 	
## 5.4 	METERING DEVICES FOR SETTING PRESS INTO OPERATION 	
(0057.000) 	
### 5.4.1 	HYDRAULIC 	

At the pipelines, valves, consumer points there are connections of system "Minimeß. Setting of the 	
- orifices and 	
- throttles etc. 	

can be effected during final assembly at your works. Normally, additional examinations and adjustments when setting press into operation are not necessary. Solonoid valves have a light emitting diode at plug 	connections, so that a cable breakage will be easily 	
detected and repaired.

### 5.4.2 	ELECTRICS 	(0058.000) 

The switch conditon of individual valves per each module will be indicated on the luminous diagram. For this purpose the press must be run through its setting procedure. The prorated switch condition of the individual hydraulic valves is to be seen in the respective hydraulic circulation diagram. All valves are equipped with plug-in connection and luminous diode. Cable breakage can be easily detected.

## 5.5 	EXCHANGE RESPECT. DISMANTLING OF CHARGER BOX MIXER 	(0059.000)

Dismantling of charger box mixer can only be effected when the complete mould packet has been removed out of the press. (see herefore sketch Pr.S. 6424). For this purpose, 	
- the charger carriage will be travelled into its maximum outer position, 	
- press piston to be lowered, 	
- 4 ring screws M16 to be screwed into the piston plate 	
- the charger box mixer will be screwed off the charger carriage, 	
- the mould fixing frame will be travelled into its lowermost position, 	
- by means of a chain or rope, the charger mixer will be connected to the piston plate , 	
- the piston plate will be travelled up.

Now the mixer is hanging free and can be taken away by means of a fork lift. 	
__Attention:__ 	
Exchange of mixer shovels will be possible in the charger carriage. The housing of the charger box mixer can be tilted upwards. When mounting new mixer shovels, their exact angular position has to be observed. (20degrees ) 	

## 5.6 	WORKING STEPS EOR THE FIRST COMMISSIONING OF PLANT 	(0060.000) 	
A careful 	assembly and commissioning decide largely on the long-life 	of the individual machinery component . 	
Directions : 	
- Check tank for cleaness . 	
- Pump the prescribed HLP oil via the machine s—own filter combination into the oil tank. Filter fineness: 5 um. 	
- Check on the connections, screwings, valves and elements for any leakages. Leakages have to be eliminated by sealing, and the oil has to be removed . 	
- Switch on main switch. 	
- Switch on oil heating . 	
- Fill pressure accumulator bladder with nitrogen as indicated; use filling device for this purpose. 
- Set pressure valves and pressure switch to zero. 	
- Open all manual valves (pump suction and cooling water valve) . 	
- Switch on the control . 	
- Wait till the starting temperature of the has been reached . 	
- Check on direction of revolution: switch on/ off the circulation pump for a short while; 	
(remove the electrical fuses of all the other pumps) . 	
- Let the circulation pump run for about 1 hour: the valves are automatically blocked. 	
- Put the fuses back into place / resp. switch on.	
- De—air pumps via the de—airing screws; turn fanwheel of motor by hand. 	
- Check on direction of rotation 	— accumulator loading pump to be switched on/ off for a short time.
- De—air the pipelines via the relief screws. 	
- Close the accumulator relief valves by hand. 	
- Accumulator pressure at the pressure switch SD2 min. and 	SD2 max. to be checked as to the values given with the respective hydraulic diagramme . 	
- Open the throttle valves only a little, so that there will only be a small flow through. Set the pressure valves to the most minute pressure possible, so that not the total oil quantity will be spattered. The oil quantity thus will be reduced to a minimum; even if a 	remaining small quantitiy of trapped air is in the consumers, no jerky, explosive—like movements will occur. 	
- Press directional valves by hand; move the various cylinders individually. 	
- Pipelines and cylinders are de—aired at special throttle screws until no further oil-foam will escape. 	
- By manual operation of the valves, go through the single movements of the charger, mould frame etc. several times, at lowest possible pressures .
