## 4.5 VALVE DENOMINATIONS 	(0050.000)
All valves and devices of the press are labeled to prevent a mix-up. The brass labels show the following:
- electrical denomination
- valve position as shown in hydraulic diagramme.The valves are grouped in the following lists; in addition their individual standard setting is indicated.
